# Prostate cancer vs Bladder cancer 
Prostate cancer is a form of cancer that originates in the prostate gland, which is a tiny walnut-shaped gland in males found right below the bladder (Litwin et al, 2017). Seminal fluid, which nourishes and transports sperm, is produced by the prostate gland. Prostate cancer develops when abnormal cells in the prostate gland expand and divide uncontrolled, resulting in the formation of a tumor. Although prostate cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in men, the majority of cases progress slowly and do not cause considerable damage. Treatment choices for prostate cancer are determined by various criteria, including the stage of the disease, the aggressiveness of the tumor, the individual's age and overall health, and personal preferences. 

Bladder cancer is a form of cancer that begins in the cells that line the bladder, which is the organ that stores pee. Bladder cancer often begins in the bladder's innermost layer and can spread to deeper layers if left untreated (Kamat et al, 2016).  Urine testing, imaging tests, cystoscopy, and biopsies are common tests and procedures used to diagnose bladder cancer. Treatment choices for bladder cancer are determined by a number of criteria, including the tumor's stage and grade, as well as the individual's overall health and personal preferences.
