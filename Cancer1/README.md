# Breast Cancer vs Mastitis
Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that develops in breast tissue, usually in the milk ducts or lobules. It happens when normal breast cells get genetic abnormalities that enable them to grow and divide uncontrolled, resulting in the formation of a tumor (Sun et al, 2017). Breast cancer can affect both men and women, however women are far more likely to be affected. It is the most common cancer in women and the second biggest cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Breast cancer is diagnosed using a mix of techniques, including clinical breast examination, imaging tests (such as mammography, ultrasound, or MRI), and tissue biopsy for microscopic study. The biopsy assists in determining the kind of breast cancer, its aggressiveness, and the presence of particular receptors, which dictate treatment recommendations. Treatment options for breast cancer are determined by a number of criteria, including the tumor's stage, size, and features, as well as the individual's overall health. Surgery (such as a lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or hormone therapy are all options for treatment. In a tailored treatment plan, a combination of these treatments is frequently used.

Mastitis is a type of infection and inflammation of the breast tissue that mostly affects breastfeeding women. Bacteria generally enter the breast through a broken or irritated nipple, causing infection and irritation. Staphylococcus aureus, which is naturally found on the skin and in the baby's mouth, is the most frequent bacteria that can cause mastitis (Kang & Zhang, 2022). Bacteria that enter the breast can grow and produce an illness. Mastitis can be an unpleasant and stressful ailment, but with early detection and adequate treatment, it is usually treatable efficiently and without problems. Mastitis is often treated with a combination of self-care and medicinal therapies.
