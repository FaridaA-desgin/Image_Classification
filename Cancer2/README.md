# Pancreatic Cancer vs Gallstone
Pancreatic cancer is a form of cancer that begins in the cells of the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach in the abdomen. The pancreas is essential for digestion and hormone production, particularly insulin production. Pancreatic cancer develops when pancreatic cells undergo genetic abnormalities that enable them to proliferate and expand uncontrolled, resulting in the formation of a tumor. It is a dangerous malignancy with a high fatality rate. It is frequently identified at an advanced stage, making treatment difficult (Kamisawa et al ,2016). Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed using a variety of approaches, including a review of the patient's medical history, a physical examination, medical imaging tests, and a biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer cells. Treatment choices for pancreatic cancer are determined by a number of criteria, including the tumor's stage, location and size, and the individual's general health. Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments may be used in treatment. Palliative care is also an important part of symptom management and quality of life for those with advanced pancreatic cancer.

Gallstones are stones that occur in the gallbladder, which is a tiny pear-shaped organ under the liver. Bile, a digestive fluid generated by the liver, is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine to help in fat breakdown. Gallstones form when chemicals in the bile, such as cholesterol or bilirubin (a pigment formed from the breakdown of red blood cells), become overly concentrated or when the components of bile are imbalanced (Sanders et al, 2007). Gallstones can be as little as a grain of sand or as huge as a golf ball. A medical history review, physical examination, and imaging tests are often used to diagnose gallstones. Blood tests may also be used to assess liver function and rule out other potential causes of symptoms. The existence or absence of symptoms influences gallstone treatment. Treatment may not be essential if gallstones are silent and do not cause any problems.
