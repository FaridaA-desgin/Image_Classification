# Lung Cancer vs Pneumonia
Lung cancer is a form of cancer that starts in the lungs' cells. It is the largest cause of cancer-related deaths globally and is one of the most frequent types of cancer. Lung cancer can start in the cells that line the airways or in the cells that make up the lung tissue (Patz et al, 2020). Tobacco smoke, especially secondhand smoke, is the leading cause of lung cancer. Smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes dramatically increases the chance of acquiring lung cancer. Nonsmokers can develop lung cancer as well, though the risk is significantly lower. Exposure to environmental contaminants, a family history of lung cancer, and past chest radiation therapy are all risk factors for lung cancer. Lung cancer is often diagnosed using a combination of imaging tests, such as chest X-rays or CT scans, and biopsy, which involves extracting a sample of lung tissue for inspection under a microscope. Once identified, lung cancer treatment choices are determined by a number of criteria, including the kind and stage of the disease, as well as the individual's general health. Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments may be used in treatment.

Pneumonia is a common and possibly fatal infection of the lungs. It is distinguished by inflammation and infection of one or both lungs' air sacs (alveoli). Bacteria, viruses, fungus, and parasites are some of the microorganisms that can cause pneumonia (Yuping & Youngjun, 2021). Bacteria is the most prevalent cause of pneumonia, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being a prominent culprit. Pneumonia may affect people of all ages, although it is more prevalent and often more severe in children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. A physical examination, medical history, and imaging tests such as a chest X-ray or computed tomography scan are commonly used to diagnose pneumonia. Blood testing, sputum analysis, or a respiratory sample may be taken in some circumstances to identify the exact organism causing the infection. Pneumonia treatment is determined on the etiology and severity of the infection. Antibiotics are frequently used to treat bacterial pneumonia, although supportive care is needed to manage symptoms until the body's immune system clears the infection.
